# WARNING: Here be hacky code

Like, this is just something really really rough I started hacking together over the course of a night.

It's really just an experiment, and not production style code at all.

The goal is to have multiple players (soundcloud, html5 audio) coordinating with each other on the page to play sound. If soundcloud is playing, then html5 shouldn't be, and vice versa.

This was implemented because I wanted to see if I could get it working, as previously I've had various clients or prospective clients ask for stuff like this. Oh, I also threw in react-router to show that page navigation without stopping audio also works. That was fun.
